### An OCR for small pictures with a restricted set of symbols

An OCR program for small handwritten numbers like 135.8 or 4,2. The pictures come from [AI4Good---Meza-OCR-Challenge](https://github.com/Charitable-Analytics-International/AI4Good---Meza-OCR-Challenge).

Try out the notebooks!

* [training.ipynb](https://github.com/colaprograms/2019-hackathon-ocr-wymbah/blob/master/notebooks/training.ipynb) trains a model.
* [beamtst.ipynb](https://github.com/colaprograms/2019-hackathon-ocr-wymbah/blob/master/notebooks/beamtst.ipynb) shows you how to use it.

The repo comes with a couple of trained models already, as you can see in the second notebook `beamtst.ipynb`.

NOTE: This is not the code that we submitted in the hackathon. That is here: (https://bitbucket.org/gro-tekcubtib/mila-ctc-ocr/src/master/)

This is the codebase that I was building, which took an extra day to debug.
